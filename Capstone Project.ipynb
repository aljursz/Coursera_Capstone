    "According to a 2019 study from Ryerson University, Toronto was the second fastest growing Metropolitan Area and the top growing city in all of the United States and Canada.  The population of Toronto increased by 77,435 persons, far out pacing the next city – Phoenix with 25,288.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this large influx of people, more business will be required to support them including gyms, retail stores, restaurants, etc.  One of the main questions, and one of the main reasons for success, regarding opening a business is - as they say “location, location, location”.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will analyze current venue locations in Toronto to determine possible new locations for opening a Bakery.\n"
